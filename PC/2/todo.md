## Recursion

1) Geometric Sum

2) Staircase<br>

A child is running up a staircase with n steps, and can hop either 1 step, 2 steps or 3 steps at a time. Implement a method to count how many possible ways the child can run up to the stairs.

3) Number of Trees

3) Interleavings<br>

Given two strings S (of length m) and T (of length n), you need to find and print out all the possible inter leavings that are possible of length (m + n). Inter leaving means - all possible combination of characters from both strings such that it contain all characters from both strings and, the respective ordering of characters of one string should remain same as in original. For eg. S = ab T = cd You need to find all strings of length 4 that contain all characters 'a', 'b', 'c' & 'd'. The only constraint on ordering of characters is - 'a' should always come before 'b' and 'c' should always come before 'd'. Note : Print all strings in different lines.
Sample Input : abc def
Sample Output :
 abcdef
 abdcef
 abdecf
 abdefc
 adbcef
 adbecf
adbefc adebcf adebfc adefbc dabcef dabecf dabefc daebcf daebfc daefbc deabcf deabfc deafbc defabc

4) Flags<br>

A flag can consists of only three different colors of stripes, White(W), Blue(B) and Red(R). Given an integer N, find and return the number of ways to create such flags having N stripes consisting of these three color stripes only with the following constraints - 1. Stripes of the same color cannot be placed next to each other. 2. A blue stripe must always be placed between a white and a red or between a red and a white one. Hence blue stripe cannot be placed at starting or at ending. 3. Its not necessary to use all three colors.
Input Format : Single Integer N
Output Format : Single Integer representing number of ways to create a flag
Sample Input 1 : 3
Sample Output 1 : 4
Sample Output 1 Explanation : Possible flags with 3 stripes are : WRW, WBR, RWR, RBW
